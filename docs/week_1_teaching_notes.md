{: .objective }
> In this session, our goal is to familiarize with open-source projects on GitHub.

## Intro and instructor <a id="intro"></a>

Introduce myself/instructor

- I code a lot - you see in the activity chart when I took vacation
- It takes 10 years to become good at something
- Git/Python/R: for my research projects
- Enjoyment/challenge/making an impact: that's what I want you to experience in this project.

Introduce Teaching assistant

Learn about students

- Degree program (WI/ISM?)
- Experience in programming, in git/python, open-source development? - always helpful
- We "only" need EiAPs and JaP. If you have not completed these, participate in the project in the next semester(s)

## What you will learn <a id="what-you-will-learn"></a>

**Git/GitHub**

Highlight the rapid diffusion of Git/GitHub (Microsoft paid 7.5 billion = Milliarden) and the massive investments to change versioning systems (core infrastructure)

Ask students why Google, AirBnB etc. would publish code?

- Open Source works better
- Identify and attract talent (they may be very picky)

**Python**

- Highlight: not throw-away code!

**Open-Sourcing**

- Github platform: tests, continuous integration, forks, ...
- Roles: developer and maintainer
- Published code contribution as an opportunity to develop a profile
- Highlight: your contribution will be public/used by others!

<!-- https://blog.seancoughlin.me/market-yourself-with-a-killer-github-readme -->

## The project: CoLRev <a id="the-project-colrev"></a>

- Ambition: Open-source environment for literature reviews (like R for statistics, or Python for ML)
- Ask students: who has already completed a literature review?
- Mention that our approach currently focuses on the command line. What are possible reasons?
- Git as an inspiration: rapid adoption (not because there were shiny interfaces, but because the data management was very efficient, reliable, and scalable to large teams)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Agenda <a id="agenda-groups-criteria"></a>

- Outline the sessions
- Highlight that we offer in-person hacking sessions in the main work phase (week 6-11)
- Very easy to schedule (Calendly), on short notice, online or in-person, whole team or part of it
- We will discuss the current progress and next steps
- We will help you solve the challenging tasks (we will not solve them for you)
- Be prepared for the meeting: be able to explain the problem, describe and evaluate the different options you know
- The hacking sessions should ensure a steady development flow. If you get stuck for more than a couple of days, meet with us!

**How groups will form**

- We do not assign you to groups. **You assign yourself by starting to contribute** (issue discussions and code).
- You have to **signal your intent to contribute** by contributing to the issue discussions.
- Choose issues strategically - **only the first 5 contributors will be accepted** for the group.

The process resembles open-source projects, involving self-selection (instead of fixed assignment to groups), communicating in public issues, creating pull requests
You can select the topics that you are interested in by contributing code.

Organize ...

Sign-up

- You can only contribute to a group if you have signalled your intent in the issue discussion before.
- Your participation will be confirmed and your account will be linked to the project issue.

Prior experience:

- The process has worked very well in previous semesters.
- Please let us know if there are any problems in finding a group.
- We reserve the right to change group (use fixed assignments) if needed.

We have several **incentives to start contributing early** instead of creating a large commit at the end.

## Criteria

Clear message:

- You have to learn Git and Python. I will provide an introductory session, but you will need to invest more time.
- You are expected to set up your environment. We are available to answer questions, but we cannot setup individual machines.
- **Everyone is expected to program and contribute**. With git, we see contributions, which prevents free-riding.

## How you can make the project a success <a id="how-to-success"></a>

See slides

**How the project may benefit you**

- Highlight: your contribution will be public/used by others!

## Finding things in an Open Source project <a id="orientation-in-open-source-projects"></a>

Small groups web research task ("scavanger hunt")

- Assessing open-source projects and finding things is an important skill.

After 8-10 mins: ask whether students have completed the task (give more time if necessary).

Solutions

- Readme
- Readme: Related work
- Documentation link
- License and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Issue template
- Issues / Pull-requests tabs (e.g., good-first-issue label as a typical starting point when joining an open-source project)
- Actions with log
- Unpaywall: search in the docs
- Issues -> Milestones

Discuss software selection criteria (for open-source projects) more broadly. What would you look for? Nr commits/issues,... Why?

Discuss / explain the git/open-source community structure

## Until next session <a id="next-steps"></a>

Study colrev docs

Explore issues in the milestone.

Show that each issue has specific pointers to the code, mention that I am available to answer questions, provide feedback in the hacking sessions

Register:

- Student e-mail address: wegen Codespaces Kontingent

Challenge: set up your own environment

Any questions?

Briefly show/explain the [page](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"}: materials and deliverables

Mention our comprehensive improvement efforts. We already have very good evaluations, but we stretch to improve even more!

- Encourage feedback (last slide)
- Show issues (improvement): https://github.com/digital-work-lab/open-source-project/issues/8
- We invest a lot of effort (show https://github.com/digital-work-lab/open-source-project/graphs/contributors)
- We even published a Teaching Tip (on Git)
- Ask students to leave us a star
