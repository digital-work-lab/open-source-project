# Git Resources

## Glossary

- **Version Control**: A system to manage changes to source code over time, allowing collaboration and tracking of revisions.
- **Commit**:  Snapshot of changes made to one or more files in a repository, saved with a unique identifier, allowing you to track and manage the history of your project.
- **Branch**: Movable pointer to a specific commit, allowing you to work on separate lines of development.
- **Merge**: Process of combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Merge Conflict**: Occurs when changes from different branches conflict with one another during merging, requiring manual resolution.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another, often used for code review in open-source workflows.
  Pull requests can refer to branches in the same repository or in a fork.
- **Git Reset vs. Revert**: Commands for undoing commits, either by removing them or by creating a new commit to reverse changes.
- **Atomic Commits**: Small, focused commits that group related changes together to improve clarity and history tracking.
- **Origin**: The default name Git gives to the remote repository when it's cloned.
  It typically has the remote prefix (`remote/origin`) and refers to the source repository from which your local repository is cloned.
- **Fork**: A copy of a repository that is created under a different user's account.
  It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository.
  Forks can be used to contribute to the original (primary) repository or to create a more independent, or even competing project.
- **Upstream**: Refers to the primary repository from which a fork is created.
  It is the main project that your local or forked repository is tracking.
