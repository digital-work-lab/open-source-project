# Weeks 6-11: Group work and hacking sessions

In weeks 6 to 11, the groups focus on completing their project work.
We offer hacking sessions to discuss current progress and help solve challenges.

{: .objective }
> The objective for this phase is to work as a team to develop a solution by writing, testing, and documenting code that effectively addresses the problem.

Hacking sessions can be in-person ([WE5 1.081](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=49.903159&mlon=10.869936#map=19/49.903159/10.869936){: target="_blank"}) or online.
To make an appointment, simply schedule a meeting using the Calendly tool:

{: .text-center}
[Schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: .btn .btn-green target="_blank"}
{: .text-center}

We expect you to try hard to solve the challenges yourself.
Struggling with errors is part of the process.
At the same time, if you continue to struggle with the same error for more than three days, please make an appointment, and let's see how to solve it.
We are here to help and make sure that you achieve steady progress throughout the group work phase.

{: .info }
> If you have questions about your code or error encounter errors, please share a link to the fork/branch containing the code.

We encourage you to open the pull request early.
You can still work on your branch, and the pull request will automatically reflect the latest changes to that (online) branch.
In fact, starting pull requests early is good practice to allow for some time for code review and improvements.

{: .deliverable }
![tasks logo](../assets/iconmonstr-clipboard-5.svg) Create the pull request ([deadline](../index.html#deliverables)). We will evaluate the code four days before the code review session.
