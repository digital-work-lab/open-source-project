"I liked the fact that we were able to work very freely and independently on our problem as a group, but that we were always able to make appointments with Prof. Wagner at very short notice if we had problems or questions. This gave me the impression that we were working we were working *with* the lecturer on the problem and finding the best solution rather than blindly choosing the first solution that came along. In my opinion, working independently on a complex problem is the most important skill that I improved with the help of the project."<br><br>
"The support I received throughout the project was particularly good, as was the opportunity to deal with topics that were not previously available at the university, but which can be extremely important for your professional life." \[[more](evaluations.html)\]

**Summary**

In software development, open-source development environments and open-source workflows are gaining importance and are embraced by large tech companies.
Git plays a central role in this context. Since its release in 2005, the market share of the decentralized and collaborative version control system has gained a market share of approximately 90%.
As a result, Git-based platforms such as GitHub and GitLab have largely displaced alternatives like SourceForge (Subversion), and even large projects like the development of the Windows operating system have migrated to Git.
Today, Git is an integral part of scaling extensive and highly distributed software development projects.

Against this background, the goal of this project is to understand and use Git-based open-source workflows and development environments (e.g., pull requests, forks, and continuous integration).
Within the framework of an existing open-source project, [CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev){: target="_blank"}, selected functionalities will be developed and contributed in small teams.
The sub-projects will be presented in the first session of the course, and preferences for topics will be taken into account when forming groups.

At the beginning of the project, three block events are planned:
(1) an overview of the open-source project and the sub-projects with subsequent topic assignments,
(2) an introduction to Git, and (3) an introduction to Python.
The subsequent work phase will be accompanied by targeted code markers for orientation in the project and by offering hacking sessions in groups.
The code review session will take place in the last weeks of the lecture period.
At that time, a completed sub-project will be reported, the results of which have been incorporated into the overarching open-source project (merged or advanced pull request).

**Weeks 6-11: Individual hacking sessions**

- One-on-one or group sessions to address specific issues and progress.
- Tasks: Create a pull request.

**Week 12: Session 6: Code review session**
- Review the code submitted by another group.
- Tasks: Implement feedback from the code review.

## Assessment and grading criteria

Our process is designed to ensure that all group members contribute fairly.
Typically, a single grade is given to the entire group.
However, if any issues arise, it is essential to raise any concerns early.
We reserve the right to assign different grades within the group and give extra points to those who make exceptional contributions.

**Process: Open-Source practices**

- Follow established Git conventions for commit messages, branching, and pull requests.
- Actively engage in the community by reviewing code, providing and incorporating constructive feedback.

**Code: Functionality**

- Implement all required features with input validation.
- Provide unit tests that cover all critical functionality.

**Code: Quality**

- Comply with Python coding standards enforced by the repository’s pre-commit hooks.
- Include documentation, including docstrings and a README with setup and usage instructions.
- Ensure clear code structure and maintain high readability.

**Evaluation scope**

Evaluation is contingent on completing the deliverables listed [here](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/#deliverables){: target="_blank"}.

**Evaluation components**

- **Code submitted in the pull request (70%)**  
  Assessment of functionality, overall code quality, and implementation of feedback.

- **Code review session (30%)**  
  Focus on collaboration, version control practices, and understanding of code.

**Not considered in the evaluation**

- Training sessions (Topics, Git, Python)
- Hacking sessions

<!-- 
**Process: Open-Source Practices**

- Proper use of Git conventions for commit messages and branching.
- Clear and descriptive pull requests with proper documentation.
- Properly address and incorporate feedback from code reviews.
- Code review: Participating in the community by reviewing others' code and providing constructive feedback.
- Ability to explain and defend your code.
- Responding to and incorporating feedback from the review session.
- Maintaining an active and professional presence in project discussions and issues.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Embrace challenges and approach problems methodically, making use of available resources and seeking help when necessary.
- **Preparation and Responsibility**: Be well-prepared for meetings and reviews, understand your code, and be able to explain your approach and decisions.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Avoid the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT for coding tasks to prevent potential copyright issues and ensure the originality of your work.
- **Open-Source Approach**: Work publicly, communicate in English, and create a professional profile on platforms like GitHub.

## Student responsibilities

possibly a “how to succeed” section

- Embrace the challenge and adopt a problem-solving mindset
- Take full responsibility for setting up your programming environment
- Be prepared. Know your code, be able to explain it, and ask prepared questions (Google it, consider different options)
- Do not use generative AI such as ChatGPT because you would risk copyright infringement
- Adopt an Open-Source approach (work publicly, communicate in English, create a profile)
- Reach out and schedule individual hacking sessions via [calendly](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: target="_blank"} to discuss challenges and get feedback

## Teaching approach

- **Complex skill development**: The project focuses on teaching complex skills necessary for modern software development.
  This includes tackling challenging problems, collaborative coding in teams, and managing a complex development environment using Python, Git, Continuous Integration, Testing Environments, and Code Quality Tools.
  To ensure a rich learning experience, we support students throughout the process by asking the right questions and providing the necessary input without removing the inherent challenges.

- **Real-world impact**: We aim to empower students to make a meaningful impact by contributing to a real-world, publicly accessible Python package.
  This hands-on experience not only enhances technical skills but also provides a sense of accomplishment and relevance.
  Additionally, students can add this valuable experience to their CV, showcasing their practical contributions and teamwork skills to potential employers.

- **Transparent evaluation and improvement**: Our [evaluation criteria](syllabus.html#assessment-and-grading-criteria), [course evaluations](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/30-teaching/30_processes/30.21.evaluations.html#prior-evaluations){: target="_blank"} and [improvement efforts](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/30-teaching/30_processes/30.22.improvements.html){: target="_blank"} are documented transparently.
  This ensures that students understand how their work is evaluated and how the course progresses based on feedback and ongoing refinement efforts.
  In addition, we develop peer-reviewed teaching materials to solicit feedback from educators outside our program.

- **Diversity, equity, and inclusion**: We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment where all students feel respected and valued.
  We create a positive learning atmosphere, encouraging questions and contributions from everyone.
  We promote diversity and actively work to ensure every student has equal opportunities to succeed and contribute.
