# The Review Session

In this session, you will **adopt the perspective of a maintainer**, i.e., a gatekeeper who takes responsibility for an open source project by screening, improving, and integrating code contributions.

As a group, your goals are:

1. Download the code from the pull request (fork) to your local machine or Codespace
2. Test whether the code works as expected
3. Debug and improve the code (if necessary)
4. Document your assessment in the pull request on GitHub and suggest merging, revising, or rejecting the contribution
