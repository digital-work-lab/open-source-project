# Project: Groups, forks and setup

- Groups formed in the issue feeds
- Forks were created.
- Further questions related to GitHub or the setup?

---

# Learning objectives:

- Familiarize with Python syntax
- Learn good debugging and development practices
- Understand how to extend a Python package (CoLRev)

# Information on this session:

- Form groups of three to four participants to collaborate on the tasks, solve them together, and engage in meaningful discussions about your solutions.
- Over the course of two sessions, we will focus on refining a single module using the colrev run command, progressively enhancing it with each iteration.

# Start the Codespace

Open the Notebook: [![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-Jupyter%20Notebook-blue)](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/docs/week_3_python_notebook_1.html)

Start the Codespace in the `tutorial_python` branch of the CoLRev upstream repository.

The setup can run in the background, while we focus on the concepts.

# Python

- Supports multiple paradigms: object-oriented, procedural, or functional
- Python is an interpreted language: no need to compile (build jars) before running
- Uses indentation instead of brackets to separate blocks (such as if statements)
- Is strongly, dynamically typed
- Provides access to many packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), covering machine learning, data science, web scraping, etc.
- Python is actively developed, with new versions introducing changes in functionality and old versions no longer receiving security updates
  - Python 3.6 (2016): [Introduction of f-strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/)
  - Python 3.7 (2018): [Dictionaries are now ordered](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/are-python-dictionaries-ordered/)

For the tutorial, we switch to the `tutorial_2024_04` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev
cd colrev
pip install -e .[dev]
git fetch
git checkout tutorial_2024_04
git reset --hard ca9902e666518af1d33a368adf055c9809004433
```

- As the session progresses, you can checkout the current commits.
- Whenever you see a `git reset --hard ...` command on the following slides, you can use it to set your repository to the required state (commit).

# Best practices

- Carefully read tutorials, vignettes, and code examples (e.g., on GitHub) 
- Start with small code segments, try whether they work, and extend them
- Add or commit working code frequently
- Use code linters to ensure high code quality (run `pre-commit run --all`)
- To debug code, check whether variables have the expected values (use assert or print statements)
- When exceptions are thrown, read the Traceback:

# Next steps

- Read the [package development](https://colrev-environment.github.io/colrev/dev_docs/packages.html) documentation.
- Study code of related CoLRev packages.
- Take notes on the CoLRev-objects or libraries that will be needed.
- Remember to **stop the codespace** ([Codespaces overview](https://github.com/codespaces))
